# 📋 Overview
Chat Tools is a highly customizable Minecraft client mod that supports various features, allowing them to interoperate through commands and more.

# 📖 Glossary and Technical Details
- **Session Identifier** _(Chat Tools-specific term)_ is a string that, in single-player mode, corresponds to the current save name, and in multiplayer mode, corresponds to the server address. Related Regular Expressions use the `matches()` method for matching.
- **Pattern** _(General term)_ refers to the Regular Expression pattern. Chat Tools uses the MULTILINE mode for Regular Expressions and matches them using the `find()` method.
- Chat Tools maintains multi versions by using macro replacement. The same version of Chat Tools may exhibit slight differences between Minecraft versions.
- When processing player messages, Chat Tools removes color codes (§.).
- By enabling Advanced Tooltips (F3+H), you can hover over configuration items on the configuration page to view their keys, default values, and other details.

## Formatter Section
Format your own messages using the specified pattern. You can apply different rules to different servers.
- Pattern  
Automatically format the replacement style.  
For example:  
`&e{text}` will make your message gold on servers that support a custom color prefix of &.  
`&e{text} ~(ovo)~` will additionally personalize your message with a suffix.  
`My coordinates are: {pos}` will automatically replace `{pos}` with the current coordinates for you.
- Auto-Disable when matches...  
In some cases, we **do not want** our text to be formatted.  
These situations include (but are not limited to):  
The number of items (or `all`) sent in chat when selling items to the Chest Shop;  
Commands that begin with various special characters.  
Chat Tools' default RegEx string `^\d+$|^[.#%$/].*|\ball\b` is all that is needed.  
Of course, you can change it or add more yourself.
